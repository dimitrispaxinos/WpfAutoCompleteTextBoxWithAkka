So of course the first place I looked was Google, because I figured someone else has already written one and I could save myself some time by just using theirs.  Well, after almost an hour searching, I found nothing.  So much for being a timesaver.  Now, don't get me wrong, I found a couple of WPF animations out there, but none of them really fit what I needed.  So I just decided to bite the bullet and create my own.  After creating the animation I decided to share the fruits of my labor so that anyone else who is looking for the same thing I was, or something similar, wouldn't have as much trouble as I did."/>
